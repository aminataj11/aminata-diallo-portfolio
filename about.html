            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a senior Computer Science major studying at Towson University, passionate about IT, cloud computing and software engineering.
                I have experience with Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and React. Iâ€™m excited to apply my skills in real-world projects
                and gain hands-on experience through internships, fellowships, mentorships, and all oppotunities that encourage me to deepen my understanding of technology. 
            </p>
